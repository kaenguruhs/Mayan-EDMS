Changes
-------


Docker
^^^^^^

An empty value is now added by default to the Docker Compose variable

not being set.


Documents
^^^^^^^^^

An issue that prevented the document file and document version print form to
work correctly was fixed.


Other
^^^^^

- Fix tagged document list view permission filtering. The permission
  layout remains the same. Only the method in which the permissions is

  directly themselves.
